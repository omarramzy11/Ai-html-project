    <td>Machines don’t require frequent breaks and refreshments as like human beings.
That can be programmed to work for long hours and can able to perform the job continuously without getting bored or distracted or even tired.
Using machines, we can also expect the same kind of results irrespective of timings, season and etc., those we can’t expect from human beings.
If you are using a smartphone, it indirectly means that you are enjoying the AI by knowingly or unknowingly.
Design the methods for automation by using learning and perception have become a common phenomenon in our everyday lives.
We have our lady Siri for iOS devices or Cortana for Windows devices to help us out.
We also prefer the help from GPS for the long drives and trips. 
A smartphone is one of the apt everyday examples of how we utilize the power of AI to reduce the barriers in a day to day life.
In the part of utilities, we can find that how they predict what we are going to type and provide the suggestion to correct the human errors in spelling. That is one of the most used machine intelligence at work irrespective of industries and freelancers.
While coming to the social media users based utilities, the artificial intelligence algorithm identifies and detects the person’s face and tags the individuals while we post the photographs on the social media sites.
AI is widely deployed and utilized by the financial institutions and banking sectors to organize and manage data. Detection Of Fraud uses one of the best advantages of an artificial intelligence involvement in the smartcard-based system transactions
One of the great advantages of Artificial Intelligence is utilized in the field of medicine. We can identify the numerous numbers of medical applications which rely on AI.
Doctors/Physician assesses the patient’s health-related data and intimates the risk factors to the customers via the health care devices with the help of artificial machine intelligence.
It helps the patient to know about the side effects of different medicines and also behaves as personal digital care. Artificial surgery simulator is the great innovation part of the AI. The efficiency of that always prefers to utilize that simulator by the Professionals for the treatment.
Currently, we have huge software to detect as well as monitor the neurological disorders. It can simulate the functionality of the human brain.
Robotics is used often in the treatment for mentally sick patients to come out from their depression also make them remain active in the real world.
The current medical industry has the popular application of artificial intelligence is Radiosurgery. It helps us to operate the tumors without damaging the unaffected surrounding tissues.</td>
    <td>Can cost a lot of money and time to build, rebuild, and repair. Robotic repair can occur to reduce time and humans needing to fix it, but that'll cost more money and resources.
It's questionable: is it ethically and morally correct to have androids, human-like robots, or recreate intelligence, a gift of nature that shouldn't be recreated? This is a discussion about AI that's popular in the days.
Storage is expansive, but access and retrieval may not lead to connections in memory as well as humans could.
They can learn and get better with tasks if coded to, but it's questionable as to if this can ever become as good as humans can do such.
They cannot work outside of what they were programmed for.
They could never, or, at least, seemingly never with our technological perceptions, recieve creativity that humans have.
This can prevent sympathizing with emotions for human contact, such as in being nurses. This can also reduce wisdom can understanding.
This can prevent common sense occuring. Even if coded with common sense and to learn, it seems hard for them to get as much common sense that humans could.
Robots, with them replacing jobs, can lead to severe unemployment, unless if humans can fix the unemployment with jobs AI can't do or severly change the government to communism.
As seen partially with smartphones and other technology already, humans can become too dependent on AI and lose their mental capacities.
Machines can easily lead to destruction, if put in the wrong hands. That is, at least a fear of many humans.
AI as robots can supercede humans, enslaving us.</td>
