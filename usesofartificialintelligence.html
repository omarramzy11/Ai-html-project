<h2>Applications of AI: </h2>

 <h3>in healthcare.</h3> The greatest wagers are on improving patient results and diminishing expenses. Organizations are applying AI to improve and quicker diagnoses than people. Outstanding amongst other known medicinal servicesadvances is IBM Watson. It comprehends regular language and can react to questions asked of it. The system mines understanding information and other accessible information sources to frame a theory, which it at that point presents with a certainty scoring mapping. Other AI applications incorporate utilizing on the web virtual wellbeing associates and chatbots to support patients and medicinal services clients discover clinical data, plan arrangements, comprehend the charging procedure and complete other managerial procedures. A variety of AI advancements is likewise being utilized to foresee, battle and comprehend pandemics, for example, COVID-19. 
 <h3>in business.</h3> AI calculations are being coordinated into investigation and client relationship the executives (CRM) stages to reveal data on the most proficient method to all the more likely serve clients. Chatbots have been joined into sites to offer immediate assistance to clients. Computerization of employment positions has likewise become an idea among scholastics and IT experts. 
 <h3>in education.</h3> AI can automate grading, giving educators more time. It can assess students and adapt to their needs, helping them work at their own pace. AI tutors can provide additional support to students, ensuring they stay on track. And it could change where and how students learn, perhaps even replacing some teachers.
 <h3>in law.</h3> The discovery process -- sifting through documents -- in law is often overwhelming for humans. Using AI to help automate the legal industry's labor-intensive processes is saving time and improving client service. Law firms are using machine learning to describe data and predict outcomes, computer vision to classify and extract information from documents and natural language processing to interpret requests for information.
 <h3>in manufacturing.</h3> Manufacturing has been at the forefront of incorporating robots into the workflow. For example, the industrial robots that were at one time programmed to perform single tasks and separated from human workers, increasingly function as cobots: Smaller, multitasking robots that collaborate with humans and take on responsibility for more parts of the job in warehouses, factory floors and other workspaces.
 <h3>in security</h3> AI and machine learning are at the top of the buzzword list security vendors use today to differentiate their offerings. Those terms also represent truly viable technologies. Artificial intelligence and machine learning in cybersecurity products are adding real value for security teams looking for ways to identify attacks, malware and other threats.

Organizations use machine learning in security information and event management (SIEM) software and related areas to detect anomalies and identify suspicious activities that indicate threats. By analyzing data and using logic to identify similarities to known malicious code, AI can provide alerts to new and emerging attacks much sooner than human employees and previous technology iterations.

As a result, AI security technology both dramatically lowers the number of false positives and gives organizations more time to counteract real threats before damage is done. The maturing technology is playing a big role in helping organizations fight off cyberattacks
